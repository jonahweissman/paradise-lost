The work gives reason to evil: all the questions that were previously unanswerable ("Why do bad things happen to good people?", "Why does war exist?", etc.) are now attributed to a corrupting force introduced in the beginning of time that God allows. By discussing the nature of evil, Milton suggests that evil could exist within a framework where God is both omnipotent and all benevolent. Specifically, God allows evil to exist for good to exist in comparison--good (God) is relatvie, and cannot exist without the opposite side.
