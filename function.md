> What is the function of this work based on your reading of the first book?

"To justify the ways of God to men" (1.26). The work gives reason to evil: all the questions
that were previously unanswerable ("Why do bad things happen to good people?", "Why does war exist?",
etc.) are now attributed to a corrupting force introduced in the beginning of time that God allows.
By discussing the nature of evil, Milton suggests that evil could exist within a framework where
God is both omnipotent and all benevolent. Specifically, God allows good and evil to exist in a morally ambigious spectrum
-- good (God) is relative, and cannot exist without the opposite side. God emphasizes
the significance of good by creating this dichotomy.
