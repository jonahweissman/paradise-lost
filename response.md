> What is your response to Milton's observation?
Is the distinction between good and evil as black and white as we think? Most people think that the world exists in shades of gray. Some people think that people that do morally questionable things still get to go to excellent colleges, yet those that may have conducted themselves in a moral way do not get to do that. Why? Does it actually matter?
