Milton places the blame of all evil actions on Satan through the tempetation of Eve. Milton sees humans as subject to the forces of good and evil. Since God is good and Satan is evil, the duality of good and evil in humans is represented. This is shown in how those that do immoral thigns may succeed and those that are moral may not succeed.
