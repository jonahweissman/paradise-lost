Evil may not have always been inherent in humans; we were corrupted by Satan. Therefore,
we are influenced by both good and evil. Perhaps recognizing that evil is an outer force
would allow humanity to reject the prevalence of evil. The balance of power
between God and Satan provides evidence that all
humans have a duality of good and evil within them.
