> What is your response to Milton's observation?

Morality is oversimplified in Paradise Lost. Good and evil exist in the universe together, not completely separate in humans. Humans have both good and evil in them they have the free will to decide which way they want to go, but Milton suggests that sometimes it is just in their nature through his depiction of Satan as a tragic hero.
