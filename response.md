> What is your response to Milton's observation?

The work allows humans to shrug off responsibility and gives all agency to the divine.
These dueling arguments--that God allows evil (therefore not benevolent) or that God is only
responsible for good (and therefore weak)--create a tension between a trust and distrust of God;
humans are left unsure of what is in their human nature and what has been forced upon them by something greater than them.
Good and evil exist in the universe together,
not completely separate in humans.
